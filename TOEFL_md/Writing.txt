In my opinion, the government should enhance the transportation system between the urban area and the 
rural one. More detailed, the government should build more roads and highways to connect the urban area 
and the rural one. In addition, the government should also build more public transportation such as buses, 
trains, and subways to connect the urban area and the rural one. This will make the transportation system 
between the urban area and the rural one more convenient and efficient. As a result, the people in the 
rural area can go to the urban area more easily and the people in the urban area can go to the rural area 
more easily. This will make the people in the urban area and the rural area more connected and the people 
in the urban area and the rural area can communicate with each other more easily. It can solve the problem
Kelly mentioned that rural area is lack of places for entertainment and culture as we can aquire them in a 
minute by taking the public transportation to the urban area. In conclusion, the government should enhance 
the transportation system between the urban area and the rural one.
