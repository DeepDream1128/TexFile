In my opinion, we can protect our environment by supporting environment-friendly products, which means we should buy the products which are manufactured by renewable resource and can be recycled after they are used. For example, chopsticks made from bamboo should be prioritized as bamboo requires less water and no pesticides to grow, can significantly reduce the environmental footprint. Moreover, we can encourage the companies to produce more so that they can cut the pollution during their production process by purchasing those products. Although individual power is little, if we can affect the great enterprise by adding up our power, it will benifit the environment much as industry is the main source of pollution. The more renewable resource they use, the less pollution they make. In conclusion, I believe it will be effective if we prioritize to purchase environment-friendly products.

In my opinion, it is effective to apply for an exchange to the local university. First of all, it's cheap for a university student to acquire such an exchange as the university will pay all of the tution fees so that we can save a lot of money. Moreover, we can interact with the local students to learn their culture. For example, when I was a freshman, I took a course about the American culture and I was really interested. As an result, I searched exchanging project on our university's website for an oppotunity and it was really amazing that there were sufficient projects. Then in the summer vocation, I attended the summer session hold by University of California, Berkeley extention. It was dramatically enjoyable for me to enter the course about the local culture, make projects and presentations with my local classmates and communicate with professors. Therefore, the local culture left deep impression on me. In conclusion, appling for an exchange is a great choice.
