The reading and the lecture both discuss  the Chaco structures. The author believes that there are several theories which can explain the usage of them . However, the lecturer disagree with the argument.

To begin with, according to the reading, Chaco structures are were used as residential areas for hundreds of people. On the other hand, the lecturer argues that it isn't convincing because there are few fireplaces which shows that there were residents cooked inside. More detailed, the space of them was enough for hundred of people, but only amount for ten more people of fireplaces is found. This is the point directly contradicts what the passage indicates.

Moreover, the author claims that the Chaco structures were places for food storation. On the contrary, the lecturer rebuts that it's not true as it is impossible to store maize on the floor. In addition, there aren't big containers which can store the maize inside. This is another point wherethe listening opposes the reading passage.

Finally, the author contends that the Chaco structures were ceremonial center. Nevertheless, the lecturer retorts that there is only trash like sand ,stone, and something used to contain trash such as pots and pipes. It is not formal. This is the last point that the listening strongly disapproves of the passage.
