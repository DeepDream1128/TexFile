Conclusion

Opinion：In my opinion, It's a great choice to apply for an exchange to the local university.

Reason 1 : To begin with, I can be supported by my university to save costs

Reason 2: Moreover, I can learn local culture by interacting with my local classmates.

In modern society, students are under high peer pressure. If students take action to take extra class, they would cunsume more energy and lose interest on study. Consequently, they would be not capable to focus on class as well as screw up their life.

In modern society, people need to work hard in order to get a decent life. If people take action to order food online, it will take them less time. Obviously, people's work efficiency will increase as they can focus on work all the time instead of wasting time to line up in the supermarket. Consequently, it can save a lot of time.

In my opinion, It's a great choice to apply for an exchange to the local university. To begin with, it is easy to get support from my university to save costs. Annually, there are several chances for university students to apply for which allow them to study in another university they select without any fees.

# Practice

For example, when I have trouble in my experiment, like some occasional errors, I'd like to watch some television serial to improve my mood.

In my opinion, giving grades based only on performance is better. To begin with, as Kelly said, it's unfair for those whose accuracy is higher, as it can reflect that they effort more than those who have more incorrect answer. Furthermore, I believe that if grading students on their effort, students will more likely to cheat in their homework and it's really hard to reveal their negative behavior. For example, how can teachers differ that which assignment which is full of correct is cheated? Only the god knows.However, if teachers only grade students on their performance, they can avoid the problem because cheat is meaningless as well as it will make their grade worth.  In conclution, grading students only by their performance is more fair.

The passage and the leture both discuss the decline of reading literature. The author believe that this trend really make him worried. However, the lecturer disagree with his argument.

To begin with, according to the reading, literatural reading decline sharply so that people will be lack of intellectual stimuterlation. On the other hand, the lecturer argues that people can read science writing or news journals instead, as they are difficult enough to provide such stimulation and people will also benefit a lot. This is the point directly contradicts what the passage indicates.

Moreover, the author claims that the culture level will lower if people give up reading literature. On the contrary, the lecturer rebuts that nowadays people have less time than the past. As the contamporary culture is changed, people have rights to choose new type of media to replace the literature and it is a kind of progress of culture. This is another point where the listening opposes the reading passage.

Finally, the author contends that the literature is fallen because of the poor standard of readers. Nevertheless, the lecturer retorts that it is those author's fault as their work is difficult to understand. This is the last point that the listening strongly disapproves of the passage.

In morden society, people have many ways for entertainment. If people used to watching television, they will save a large amount of money. We can suppose that if people do not watch television, they will find other things instead, such as gambling, going to some places which are really expensive, or traveling. These activities are far more expensive. So for those who lack money, watching television is a really cost-effective way. Considering the following hypothetical situation, a worker who need entertainment after working in a site for a whole week. His colleage may invite him -- or even deceive him to

I believe that sharing information on social media site is a ditraction from study. Take me as an example. When I was 14 years old, I achieve a perfect score in my final math examination, so my parents reward me a smart phone. Then I really addicted to upload my daily experience to Weibo as I could not control myself to read comments and commends from others on Weibo, such as my friends, relatives and even strangers. Obviously, it took me a lot of time, 4 hours a day on average, to edit my blogs so that I had little time to do my math assignment. What I can do was coping other's  homework. As a result, my academic performance declined rapidly as I almost cannot pass the math examination in the next semester.
